Project 6: Machine Learning
Created Neural Nets to handle Linear Regression Models, Non-linear models, and Digit and Language classification models. Addtionally used batching for larger scale data input efficiency.

Started by creating a binary perceptron algorithm before adding additional features to work up the the Language classification model.
